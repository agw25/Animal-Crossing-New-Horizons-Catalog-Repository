This folder contains 30 CSV files containing items, such as villagers, clothing, fish, bugs, art, etc., from the 2020 Animal Crossing New Horizons item catalog list. 
The files do not contain images from the original spreadsheet. Each CSV file is broken up into its unique setup, but the various files share common themes of name, price, and item variations.
