Welcome! This is the final project for my LIS 545 Data Curation class taught at the University of Washington's MLIS Program. The information for the project came from Jessica Liâ€™s [Animal Crossing New Horizon](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset) dataset, which was pulled from the [Data Spreadsheet for Animal Crossing New Horizons](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/13d_LAJPlxMa_DubPTuirkIV4DERBMXbrWQsmSh8ReK4/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook) created by the Animal Crossing community.
